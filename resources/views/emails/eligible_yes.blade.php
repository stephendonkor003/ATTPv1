            <p>Dear Consortium Coordinator,</p>

            <p>
                Congratulations! We are delighted to inform you that your consortium’s proposal has successfully
                <strong>advanced to the next stage</strong> of the
                <strong>African Think Tank Platform (ATTP)</strong> technical and financial evaluation process.
            </p>

            <p>The upcoming evaluation will be conducted by the <strong>Independent Consortium of Experts
                    (ICE)</strong>,
                hosted by the <strong>African Union Commission (AUC)</strong>. During this phase, proposals will be
                rigorously assessed based on the following criteria:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Quality and Relevance (50%)</strong>: The quality of the proposal and its alignment with the
                    ATTP objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity (30%)</strong>: The capacity of key personnel and operational systems to implement
                    the proposed activities.</li>
                <li><strong>Budget (20%)</strong>: The feasibility and appropriateness of the proposed budget.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>Proposals must achieve a minimum score of <strong>70%</strong> to qualify for funding consideration.
                The scores obtained will guide the ICE in recommending proposals to the
                <strong>Think Tank Platform Steering Committee (TTPSC)</strong> for final approval.
            </p>

            <p>
                As part of the evaluation process, site visits will be conducted by representatives from ICE and AUC for
                the <strong>top-ranked 3–5 think tanks</strong> (FAQ 31). These visits will assess the capacity and
                readiness of the consortia to undertake the proposed activities effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
                Upon selection, consortia will be required to submit a more detailed annual budget to finalize the grant
                agreement.
            </p>

            <p>
                We anticipate that the evaluation process will be completed by <strong>October 10, 2025</strong>, and we
                will keep you informed of any updates or additional requirements throughout this period.
            </p>

            <p>
                Thank you for your continued dedication to advancing the goals of the ATTP initiative.
                We look forward to collaborating on the next steps in this important process.
            </p>
